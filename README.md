My personal website, version 2!

I wanted to build this site with the intent of it to be my personal playground where I can explore cool stuff that sometimes you don't get to work on a typical job.

This site is builded with Remix.

## How it's built

Theme switching

## The design 

As I'm pretty bad at designing I wanted something simple, minimalist but with cool functionalities 

## Future stuff

One of my biggest hobby is to study chinese language so I would like to add internalization to switch languages supporting english, spanish (my native language) and chinese.

As per design wise I want to add some more animations using framer motion specially I would like to add a pointer to the background like [this one.](https://pointer-animation.netlify.app/)


## Tech
